        1. Bowled:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the ball hits the stumps or bails and at least one bail come of the three stumps.
        <hr>
        2. LBW (Leg Before Wicket):
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the ball hits any body part of the batsmen (before hitting the bat or glove) and he/she is standing in front of the stumps or bails (so that he/she won't get bowled).
        <hr>
        3. Caught Behind:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the ball hits the batsmen's bat or glove and the wicket-keeper catches the ball on the full.
        <hr>
        4. Caught:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the ball hits the batsmen's bat or glove and any of the fielder's catch the ball on the full.
        <hr>
        5. C&B (Caught and Bowled):
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the ball hits the batsmen's bat or glove and the bowler him/herself catches the ball on the full.
        <hr>
        6. Run Out:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the batsmen hits or misses it and call for a run. But, in the meantime, the wicket-keeper, bowler or fielder dislodges the bail/s before the batsmen makes his ground (crease).
        <hr>
        7. Stumped (Usually When a Spin Bowler is Bowling)
        Similar to 'Run Out' but the batsmen goes to hit the ball standing out of the crease and he misses it and the wicket-keeper catches it and knocks the bail/s over before the batsmen makes his ground (crease).
        <hr>
        8. Hit Wicket:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the batsmen misses or hits the ball and hits the sumps or bail/s and at least one bail come of the three stumps.
        <hr>
        9. Timed Out:
        When the batsmen takes more than 5 minutes to come onto the pitch (wicket) when a dismissal is taken place.
        <hr>
        10. Hit the Ball Twice:
        When the bowler bowls the ball and the batsmen hits the ball twice or more (especially when trying to hit the ball when it is near the stumps so that you cannot get bowled).
        <hr>
        11. Obstucting the Field:
        When the bowler bowls it and the batsmen hits or misses the ball and the opposition players try to get a run out but the batsmen comes in the way of the ball or blocks a fielder, bowler or wicket-keeper from getting a run out.
        <hr>
        12. Retire Without the Umpire's Permission:
        When the batsmen walks of the field (without the umpire's permission) and takes more than 5 minutes to come back onto the field.
